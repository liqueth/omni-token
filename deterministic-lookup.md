## Introduction
Deploying the same contract across multiple blockchains is deceptively difficult. Contract addresses are derived from deployment context, and even with deterministic methods like `CREATE2`, differing constructor arguments yield divergent addresses. This means that contracts intended to represent the same logical component (e.g., a token or application primitive) often end up scattered across networks at inconsistent addresses.

For developers, this creates integration friction. For users, it introduces risk: selecting the wrong address on the wrong chain can lead to lost funds or broken interoperability. Off-chain registries are often used to bridge the gap, but they add trust assumptions, require constant maintenance, and are error-prone.

Counterfactual systems expose the weakness most clearly. They rely on the ability to reason about a contract’s address *before* it is deployed. If addresses differ across chains, the counterfactual model collapses.

## Deterministic Lookup
**Deterministic Lookup** is a deployment pattern that solves this coordination problem.

A contract is deployed at an identical, predetermined address on every chain, while its contents are initialized with chain-specific data. This is achieved by ensuring the deployed bytecode is identical across chains and deferring differences to immutable context (e.g., branching on `block.chainid`).

From the outside, the address is globally invariant. From the inside, the values it exposes are always correct for the local chain. The result is a single reference point that is valid everywhere, without relying on registries or trusted third parties.

## Benefits
- **Global Consistency** – One canonical address across all chains.
- **Local Correctness** – Each instance exposes the right value for its own chain.
- **Counterfactual Safety** – Systems can integrate before deployment with confidence in the address.
- **Composability** – Other protocols can use the same address as a universal reference.
- **Trustlessness** – No reliance on off-chain registries or coordinators.

## Prerequisites and Limitations
- **Global Knowledge of Chain Data** – All chain-specific values must be known at deployment. Adding new chains later requires redeployment.
- **Deterministic Deployer** – Requires a mechanism like Nick’s Factory (`CREATE2`) to guarantee identical addresses.
- **Immutable Bytecode** – Any change to the logic or constructor encoding produces a new address.
- **Initialization Boundaries** – All chain variation must be encoded without affecting the initcode hash (e.g., branching on `block.chainid`).

## Practical Trade-Offs
- **Upfront Coordination vs. Incremental Growth** – Works best with a fixed or well-defined universe of chains.
- **Simplicity vs. Extensibility** – Dramatically reduces integration friction, but cannot easily be extended with new chains or logic.
- **Determinism vs. Upgradeability** – Ties identity to immutable bytecode, making it incompatible with upgradeable patterns.
- **Efficiency vs. Flexibility** – Efficient in practice, but constrains dynamic configurability.

## Conclusion
Deterministic Lookup offers a simple, robust, and trustless way to align contracts across chains. By guaranteeing a global address while providing chain-local values, it creates a reliable primitive for cross-chain tokens, apps, and protocols. While it requires upfront knowledge of all supported chains and forgoes conventional upgrade paths, the clarity and safety it provides make it a powerful foundation for interoperable systems.
