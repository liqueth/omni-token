/// @notice Ensures the same contract address exists on every chain, with each instance
/// immutably referencing its chainâ€™s designated target.
/// @dev Deployed deterministically with CREATE2, OmniRef binds immutably to the local
/// target for the current chain. This provides a trustless reference with no governance
/// or upgrade risk, eliminating the need for off-chain registries or per-chain config.
/// Contracts, SDKs, and UIs can hardcode one address and always resolve correctly.
/// Typical uses include cross-chain endpoints (oracles, messengers, executors), wallets,
/// bridges, and explorers that require a single uniform reference across chains.
