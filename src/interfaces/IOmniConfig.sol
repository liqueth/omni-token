/**
 * @notice Base interface for omnichain configuration contracts.
 * @dev General problem:
 *      Cross-chain applications require reliable knowledge of how each supported chain
 *      is wired â€” which identifiers and addresses to use locally, and which peer chains
 *      are supported at all. If this information is scattered off-chain or maintained
 *      through mutable registries, applications become fragile, hard to audit, and
 *      dependent on trusted updaters.
 *
 *      Subclasses of this interface solve that problem by acting as immutable,
 *      on-chain sources of configuration. They provide a predictable contract address
 *      that other contracts can query to learn what version of the configuration is in
 *      effect and which chains are supported, without requiring any privileged party
 *      to maintain or update the data after deployment.
